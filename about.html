      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Yorkville High School Computer Programming Club</strong> was founded to fill a gap in extracurricular opportunities for aspiring 
        <em>game developers</em> and <em>computer programmers</em>.  
        Before the club’s creation, students who were passionate about software development had no dedicated environment 
        outside of robotics and/or in-school courses to explore programming, share ideas, or build projects together.  
        This club was built to change that — to create a welcoming community where creativity, coding, and collaboration thrive.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Sponsor</h3>
      <p>
        Our club sponsor, <strong>Mrs. Pickett</strong>, is a passionate educator within the Applied Mathematics division who encourages innovation and exploration in technology.
        She provides guidance, structure, and resources that allow our members to succeed both in and out of the classroom.  
        Her experience and enthusiasm make her an invaluable part of the club’s success.
      </p>

      <h3>Finding the Club Room</h3>
      <p>
        Meetings are held in <strong>Room C125</strong> — located in the main building near the learning stairs.  
        It is one of the rooms that have windows composing 2 out of its 4 walls. Follow the posters placed around the school when meetings are scheduled.  
        New members are always welcome to stop by and join in!
